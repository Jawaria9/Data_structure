//we will use recursion when a problem depends upon a  problem of the same nature with smaller input size
//recursion is calling the function itself 
//we use recursion when solution of the problem depends upon the solution of smaller problem 
//ie;
//n!=n*(n-1)!
//fact(n)=n*fact(n-1)
//we can convert bigger problem into smaller and smaller problem 
//in recursion we call the same function with smaller input size
//with the ouput of the smaller problem we can calculate the output of our problem
//call stack means when a function return something its work is over 
//so it goes out of the memory ans so on and at the end everything will go out of the stack we call it call stack 
//the function comes at last will go out first ,its in reverse order
