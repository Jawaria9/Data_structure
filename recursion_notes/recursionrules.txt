rules:

-->in recursion we use the recursion and solve the big problem like
first we have base case
then we have hypothesis induction which is recursion
then we use that hypothesis induction(recursion)in the induction step where the all logic is made

1)we can traverse the array from end by soling first n-1 amd moving toward 0 the start
2)we can traverse the array from start either using i varaible or by adding 1 in the addreess and decreasing size
